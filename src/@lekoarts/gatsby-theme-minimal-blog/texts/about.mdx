### A little bit about me...

> My early affinity for design and creation led me to pursue a career in computer science. I enjoy finding creative solutions to solve modern problems; software development is the medium through which my ideas translate into real-world products.
>
> I have professional experience working in CI/CD environments and have developed skills with PostgreSQL, Java, JUnit, Python, Spring, Javalin, and VueJs. Throughout various personal projects, I also have experience working with ReactJs, ExpressJs, and NoSQL.
